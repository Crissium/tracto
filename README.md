# Tracto

Just some text-processing functions for English and Chinese in Python that I keep copying from project to project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- [Regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)
- [Smartypants](https://github.com/leohemsted/smartypants.py)

## Installation

Don't bother. Just copy the file and import the functions you need. Well actually my own usage is that I keep this file physically in a random version-controlled directory and then symlink it wherever I need it.

## Licence
